            <td>Facebook is an online social media and social networking service owned by American technology giant Meta
                Platforms. Created in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with four other Harvard College students and roommates
                Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name derives from the face
                book directories often given to American university students. Membership was initially limited to
                Harvard students, gradually expanding to other North American universities. Since 2006, Facebook allows
                everyone to register from 13 years old (or older), except in the case of a handful of nations, where the
                age limit is 14 years.[6] As of December 2022, Facebook claimed 3 billion monthly active users,[7] and
                ranked third worldwide among the most visited websites.[8] It was the most downloaded mobile app of the
                2010s.[9]</td>
